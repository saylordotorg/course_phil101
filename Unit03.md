**Unit 3: Political Philosophy** <span id="3"></span> 
*Political philosophy deals with questions about how human societies
ought to be governed or how they ought to govern themselves. In this
unit, we will read selections from one major political thinker from the
East - Confucius, as well as five major political philosophers from the
West - Plato, Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, John Stuart Mill, Karl
Marx, and John Rawls<s>.</s> Despite vast differences between them, each
of these thinkers bases his political philosophy on some understanding
of human nature. How one should govern or how the state ought to be
organized depends on the basic characteristics of its members and also
on the characteristics of its rulers. For Confucius, the leader is a
virtuous human being, an idea that resonates with the previous Unit 3
material on ethics (especially the theory of Aristotle.) For Plato, it
is philosophers’ natural inclination to become intimately acquainted
with truth that makes them the perfect rulers. For Machiavelli, it is
the intrinsic tendency for human beings to be immoral and
self-interested that demands a strategic and sometimes brutal ruler. For
Hobbes, it is an even more primal animosity of human beings toward one
another that leads people to band together for mutual survival. John
Stuart Mill, in the work* On Liberty*, holds that the individual freedom
of expression and thought must be maintained and that a “tyranny of the
majority” must be avoided in life under government rule. Marx’s
political philosophy stems from his conviction that human beings are
alienated from their basic nature by capitalist societies, while John
Rawls describes a distribution of justice, goods, and liberties among
the various members of society.*

     Instructions: Click on the link above and read the webpage about
    Confucius’s political philosophy. Despite the fact that we have
    categorized Confucius as a political philosopher, much of his
    doctrine also concerns ethics. Confucius provides a general
    description of the qualities of the “superior man,” which serves as
    a model for all persons, not just rulers.  As you read about
    Aristotle’s ethics in the next unit, keep Confucius’s emphasis on
    humanity and virtue in mind.  
        
     Studying this reading should take approximately 45 minutes.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Click on the link above and read this webpage.
    Confucius’s sayings are designed for use in everyday practice. To
    that end, they are concise and memorable. With respect to the
    aphorisms on government, reflect on how Confucius’s instructions
    differ in intent from those of Machiavelli. *The Analects* were
    compiled by Confucius’s disciples during the fifth century B.C. and
    were adopted as the official philosophy of imperial China during the
    Han Dynasty (206 B.C. to 220 A.D.).

     Instructions: Read this chapter. Pay particular attention to the
    notions of *dao* (way), *xiao* (filial piety), *li* (social

    excerpts from the Analects toward the bottom of the page, especially

-   **Reading: University of Tennessee at Martin’s *Internet
    Encyclopedia of Philosophy:* Dr. W. J. Korab-Karpowicz’s “Plato’s
    Political Philosophy”**

    Philosophy”](http://www.iep.utm.edu/platopol/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this webpage about Plato’s political philosophy.
    One of the remarkable features of Plato’s philosophy is the degree
    to which all its components are integrated. This reading
    demonstrates how his views on how an ideal state ought to be
    governed follow directly from his views on the nature of reality. It
    is also important to note that scholars disagree on whether Plato
    may be using his theory of the ideal state as an ironic commentary
    on political arrangements in his time; in other words, scholars
    debate whether he was sincere or ironic in recommending certain
    rules in the ideal Republic.  
      
     Studying this reading should take approximately 2 hours.

     [HTML](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.8.vii.html) (Book
    VII)  
      
     Instructions: Read both articles. This set of readings returns us
    to Plato’s *The Republic*. It takes the form of a dialogue between
    Plato’s teacher (Socrates) and a number of interlocutors. These two
    books present the most famous statements of Plato’s metaphysics -
    usually called “the theory of forms.” Book VI focuses on his
    “analogies of the sun” and the “divided line” which set up his
    famous “allegory of the cave” in Book VII. Plato argues that it is
    philosophers who have the best access to the forms (i.e., to
    reality) and are therefore best suited to govern the state.

     Instructions: Read these webpages, ensuring to click the “Next
    Page” link to read the summary and analysis modules for all sections
    of Books VI and VII of *The Republic* (6 pages total). After reading
    these modules, you should be able to explain why Plato believes
    philosophers should govern the state. Notice that Plato’s arguments
    implicitly criticize the prevailing form of government in fifth
    century Athens: democracy.

     Instructions: Read sections 1 - 5 for an understanding of the basic
    concepts of Machiavelli’s *The Prince*. Machiavelli’s approach to
    political philosophy differs markedly from Plato’s in that instead
    of asking “How would the ideal state be governed?” he asks “How does
    a political leader gain and keep control of the state?” This
    pragmatic approach undercuts abstract deliberation by focusing on
    the realities political leaders faced during the Renaissance.

     Instructions: Read these chapters from Machiavelli’s famous manual
    on how to get and keep political power. Machiavelli composed this
    work in 1513. Unlike Plato, Machiavelli had personal experience as a
    politician, and his work marks a shift from political idealism to
    political realism. Machiavelli sanctions a great deal of duplicity
    between the prince’s public and private personas - as well as some
    forms of cruelty - as means to an end.

     Instructions: Read these chapters from Hobbes’s *Leviathan*. In
    spite of his archaic prose, try to keep track of his progression
    from the idea of the state of nature to the idea of the contract. In
    this text from 1651, Hobbes argues that political societies are the
    result of an agreement that human beings enter into in order to
    ensure their mutual survival. His article proceeds from the premise
    that without such a “contract,” human beings would destroy one
    another in a war of all against all.

    conversation (approximately 53 minutes) between two eminent
    philosophers on the “contextual approach” to Hobbes’s theory of the
    social contract. Notice how Hobbes’s conception of the social
    contract relies on his conceptions of “natural persons” (agents
    capable of representing themselves) and “artificial persons” (agents
    of the state).

    beginning at 27:00 minutes for the section on Mill. The video gives
    a summary of John Stuart Mill’s political theory and the concept of
    the Harm Principle. The Harm Principle holds that the government
    should not intervene and stop unusual or unpopular activities unless
    they harm others. Mill’s theory introduces many important concepts
    that we still mention in political debates today, like the “tyranny
    of the majority,” the “free market of ideas,” and the concept of
    informed “consent.”

     Instructions: Read this webpage. Although Marx can be difficult to
    read, the key to this text is simple: It hinges on Marx’s particular
    conception of human nature. Marx diagnoses the political situation
    of his day as intolerable because working conditions had estranged
    the people from their nature - or, as Marx says, their “species
    being.”

     Instructions: Click the Flash link and then listen to the lecture
    (approximately 48 minutes). It gives an overview of Marx’s analysis
    of the phenomenon by which laborers become physically and
    psychologically “separated” or “alienated” from the products that
    they make. This theory, by which laborers no longer identify with
    that which they spend their lives making, is a cornerstone of Marx’s
    theory of human nature when inserted into a capitalist mode of
    production.

    possibility of social mobility in the context of economic
