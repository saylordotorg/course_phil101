**Unit 4: Ethics and Moral Philosophy** <span id="4"></span> 
*Similarly to political philosophy, ethics also deals with questions of
how things ought to be rather than how they are. Ethics tends to treat
these questions at the level of the individual human being rather than
at the level of the community or the state. At various points in the
history of ethical theory, the value of ethical actions and the measure
we can use to determine if an action is good or bad have been located in
different parts of the action. Is it in the virtue, character, or moral
development of the person doing the action (this view is associated with
Aristotle and ancient Greece)? Is it located in the intentions or the
motivations that inspire the action in the first place (this view would
be associated with the early Modern period and Immanuel Kant’s ethics)?
Or, is the value of the action based in the results or the consequences
that the action brings about in the end (this would be the view of
modern utilitarian philosophers like John Stuart Mill)? Specific ethical
questions come in many forms and varieties: Is it always wrong to commit
murder? What about if it would save the lives of others or if it would
end someone’s suffering? Do people still have basic rights even if they
do something despicable? Are close family members entitled to better
treatment than strangers off of the street? Philosophers have tended to
answer ethical questions by creating general theories of how to live and
of what actions are right and wrong. In this unit, we will investigate
the three most influential ethical theories - namely, those of
Aristotle, Immanuel Kant, and John Stuart Mill. Each of these theorists
identifies a different basis for the ethical life. Ethics is grounded in
either virtue (Aristotle), duty (Kant), or the consequences of our
actions (Mill). The tricky part is figuring out which of these views is
the right one, because they each seem to resonate with different aspects
of our moral sensibilities.*

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Explain how Aristotle comes to definitions of virtue and “the good”
    as well as a definition for human happiness, and describe how these
    definitions are based on certain assumptions concerning human
    nature.
-   ExplainKant’s categorical imperative as a moral principle by
    applying the categorical imperative to hypothetical situations.
-   Compare and contrast Aristotelian, utilitarian, and Kantian notions
    of ethics by exploring virtue, duty, and the rational consequences
    of action.

     Instructions: Read this webpage about Plato’s political philosophy.
    One of the remarkable features of Plato’s philosophy is the degree
    to which all its components are integrated. This reading

    governed follow directly from his views on the nature of reality.

     Instructions: Click on the link above and select “View in iTunes”
    for the lecture titled “Aristotle - Nicomachean Ethics.” Dr.
    Warburton explains how Aristotle’s answer to the question “How
    should one live one’s life?” follows from his view that the human
    good is happiness - living in accordance with virtue. Notice that
    all of Aristotle’s virtues refer to the self and not to other
    people. This will be important when we compare his theory to those
    of Kant and Mill.

     Instructions: Click on the link above and read sections 1 - 6 about

     Instructions: Read this section. Reading Kant is very tough going.
    You will want to look out for two things in particular: his
    distinction between hypothetical and categorical imperatives and his
    formulations of the categorical imperative. Kant’s approach to
    ethics is fundamentally different from Aristotle’s approach. While
    Aristotle seeks to answer the question “How should one live one’s
    life?” Kant is more concerned with the question “What is the right
    thing to do?”

     Instructions: Read this chapter from Mill’s major ethical work.
    This selection from Mill’s treatise *Utilitarianism* presents the
    fundamentals of his ethical theory. Like Kant, Mill wants to answer
    this basic question: “What is the right thing to do?” However, in
    stark contrast to Kant, Mill asserts that it is the consequences of
    our actions that ultimately determine whether our actions are right
    or wrong, not the intentions or principles behind them. For this
    reason, views such as Mill’s theory are also referred to as a
    version of “consequentialism.”

     Instructions: Click on the link above and watch this lecture. It
    gives a background for the three major ethical theories (Aristotle,
    Kant, and Mill) and then compares Mill’s ethical theory to those of
    Kant and Aristotle. The lecture addresses the overall purpose of
    ethical theory and covers the major distinctions between the classic
    Western approaches to ethics. In comparing Kant and Mill, one major
    difference is whether our actions should be guided by principles
    (Kant) or by the consequences we expect them to have (Mill), while
    Aristotle emphasized that ethics is really not about action at all
    but rather about cultivating a virtuous character.
