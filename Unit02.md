**Unit 2: Metaphysics and Epistemology** <span id="2"></span> 
*One of the traditional philosophical questions, “What, if anything,
really exists?” has been addressed in a variety of different time
periods in history. Philosophy can perhaps be understood as a great
conversation, with different philosophers sharing ideas and trying to
answer each other’s skeptical doubts across time periods and cultures.
In seeking answers to the ultimate questions of existence and knowledge,
philosophers looked for their answers in different ways. Some
philosophers believed that the method we use to gain knowledge is most
important; that method might involve reason and thinking (rationalism)
or sensory interaction with the world around us (empiricism).
Philosophers also developed theories of what is truly “real” or what we
have knowledge of; some philosophers found that ideas and concepts are
known (idealism) and others found that matter, substance, or atoms are
what we know (idealism). What is there that we can be sure is not just
an appearance, an illusion, or a useful fiction? Do atoms really exist?
What about such abstract entities as beauty and justice? Most of us are
fairly certain that the objects we see and touch - such ordinary things
as tables and chairs, pieces of cake, and other people - really exist.
But what if even these familiar features of our world are mere phantoms?
What if the only entity that truly exists is one’s own mind? Metaphysics
is the area of philosophy that tries to specify the conditions for
something being real. Once you begin to consider the question of what
really exists, you will notice that a second question immediately
presents itself: “How do you know?” This is the central question of
epistemology. Epistemology is the area of philosophy devoted to finding
out what knowledge itself is and how it works. How do we know when we
obtain actual knowledge and not something else - something considered
“weaker,” such as belief, opinion, or, worse, just plain ignorance? What
characteristics do our thoughts require in order to qualify as genuine
knowledge? Most of the time, questions in metaphysics and epistemology
go hand in hand, and they have to be tackled together.*  
    
 *In this unit, we will examine some of the most influential
metaphysical and epistemological theories in the history of philosophy.
One of the major issues that philosophers in both the East and West
discussed was the difference between what we see around us and what is
real, eternal, unchanging, and true. The philosopher, Lao Tzu, discussed
the apparent impermanence and imperfection of the world and addressed
issues of insincerity in interpersonal relationships in the* Tao Te
Ching*. Just a few hundred years later, the Greek philosopher Plato
wrote of the cave allegory in* The Republic - *the cave is a thought
experiment that neatly demonstrates the distinction between appearance
and reality as well as the difficulty of discerning which is which. It
is a fascinating point of continuity and comparison that philosophers in
both the Eastern and Western traditions were concerned with impermanence
and the idea that appearances can deceive us. We will then examine the
problem of where our knowledge comes from - whether it comes from within
us or from outside sources. Our guides in this debate will be René
Descartes and John Locke, the principal advocates of rationalism and
empiricism, respectively. We will also see that the rationalism and
empiricism of Descartes and Locke was met with a skeptical response by
David Hume. Next, we will look at the writings of Immanuel Kant, the
thinker credited with introducing the most sweeping revolution in how we
conceptualize knowledge and reality. Finally, we will investigate George
Berkeley, whose immaterialism compares to the ancient Chinese tradition
of Daoist metaphysics and epistemology that we began our unit with, as
seen in Lao Tzu’s* Tao Te Ching.

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Define the principle pursuits of the philosophical subfields of
    metaphysics and epistemology and explain how skeptical, empirical,
    and rational approaches to these subfields have helped us pose and
    investigate crucial questions;
-   Explain how allegory can be used to advance complex philosophical
    ideas about the nature of knowledge and the real;
-   Apply basic metaphysical and epistemological argumentation,
    including synthetic and analytic judgment as well as *a priori* and
    *a posteriori* notions about the acquisition of knowledge; and
-   Compare and contrast Western philosophical ideas regarding the
    nature of reality with Eastern philosophical traditions,
    particularly Daoism.

     Instructions: Read this webpage for a sense of Daoism’s distinctive
    approach to philosophical practice. Notice that Daoism is averse to
    the type of rational discourse characteristic of Western metaphysics
    and epistemology. The Daoists would likely regard the precise
    rationality of Plato and Kant as a sign that they were far from “the

    contribute to a general worldview. The *Tao* is a collection of the
    teachings attributed to the sixth century B.C. sage Lao Tzu,
    although his status as a historical figure is disputed.  *Tao Te
    Ching* should be rendered as something like “Classic about the Way
    and Virtue.” The meaning of “Tao” lies somewhere between a truth to
    know and a path to follow. Lao Tzu’s point is precisely that the Tao
    is slippery and ineffable and can only be approached obliquely.

     Instructions: Click on the link above and select “View in iTunes”
    for the lecture titled “Plato - The Republic.” Listen to this entire
    lecture about Plato’s dialogue *The Republic*.  
      
     Dr. Warburton provides historical background for Plato’s text and
    explains how the famous cave allegory leads him to articulate his
    theory of the forms. Plato uses the story of the cave to illustrate
    how appearances can be deceiving: imagine people who have been
    imprisoned and raised their whole life in a cave, only seeing images
    and shadows on the wall of the cave, never experiencing the full
    richness of life outside the cave. The average person lives this
    way, with their senses as their only means of gaining knowledge.
    Real knowledge, of higher ideals, ethical concepts, and perfect
    truth is in the realm of the forms outside the cave. If the
    philosopher dares to break free from the cave, sees the forms
    outside, and tries to explain what they are like to the others in
    the cave, then he will understandably be skeptical and resist this
    new understanding of the “real” world.  According to Plato, the
    world of forms really exists, while the world of appearances - the
    ordinary world we all inhabit - is merely a copy. The philosopher
    plays a special role, calling our attention to the “more real” and
    more significant concepts that exist in the realm of the forms
    (concepts like truth, beauty, good, and justice).

     Instructions: Read these documents. Descartes wrote in such a way
    as to guide his readers carefully through his process of thought. He
    begins with questions many of us may have asked ourselves at one
    point or another: “How do I know I am not dreaming?” and “How do I
    know the world outside of me really exists?” As you read these
    webpages, take note of when you agree with Descartes and when you
    disagree with him. Descartes composed his *Meditations* in 1641 - a
    time when the traditional, religious, and scholastic worldviews were
    being replaced by modern, scientific ones. His writing is thus
    motivated by the desire to provide reasons for the phenomena he
    encounters in everyday life rather than accept them on the basis of
    faith or the authority of others.

    and describes how the *Meditations* attempt to provide a secure
    foundation for knowledge by starting from a position of extreme
    skepticism. Only by first eliminating every one of his beliefs that
    he can possibly doubt can Descartes arrive at an unshakeable set of
    core beliefs, on which he can then build.

     Instructions: Read sections 1 - 3, which describe the rationalist
    and empiricist approaches to epistemology. This reading gives a
    sense of the epistemological issues at stake between Descartes and
    Locke. As a rationalist, Descartes believed that we can arrive at
    certain knowledge by reasoning from ideas we hold innately.  Locke,
    as an empiricist, held the contrary view that we do not possess any
    innate knowledge but acquire everything we know through
    experience.

     Instructions: Read this chapter from Locke’s major work on
    epistemology. This excerpt is taken from a vast work, published in
    1689, in which Locke attempts to demonstrate how human beings build
    up elaborate systems of knowledge beginning from sense experience.
    He compares the mind of a child to a “yet empty cabinet,” which is
    then filled with all kinds of ideas originating from outside him. In
    order to get started, Locke has to debunk the popular notion -
    associated with Descartes and his followers - that some of our very
    first ideas are innate.

    Essay”](http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/locke-essay/id254465298?i=16822982)
    (iTunes U)  
        
     Instructions: Scroll down to \#11 and then listen to the lecture
    about Locke’s *Essay*. Pay close attention to the contrasts Dr.
    Warburton sets up between Locke’s project and the rationalist
    philosophy he was reacting against. Locke’s theory of the origin of
    our ideas is a forerunner of “cultural relativism” - the view that
    people from different cultural backgrounds hold different and often
    incompatible beliefs. However, for Locke, the central importance of
    this observation is that because different cultures hold radically
    different ideas, human knowledge cannot rest on a basis of innate,
    universally held beliefs.

    Introduction to David
    Hume”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6SYJpPNty8) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Click on the link above and view the lecture by
    Professor Millian on David Hume. Be sure to notice the way that Hume
    addresses skepticism about sensory experience as well as skepticism
    about ideas. Hume is famous for having described the problem of
    induction, in which relationships of cause and effect are frequently
    taken as given. Arguments based on cause and effect relationships
    are known in logic as “causal inferences,” and such cause and effect
    understanding of the world is considered necessary for science.

    Link: Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Dr. Matt McCormick:
    [“Kant: Metaphysics”](http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantmeta/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read sections 1 - 3, which outline Kant’s
    revolutionary metaphysical theory. If the debate between the
    rationalists and empiricists boiled down to the question as to
    whether our ideas originate from within our minds or from outside of
    them, Kant rendered their dispute obsolete by posing a more radical
    question: “What makes it possible for us to have knowledge and
    experience at all?” Instead of our knowledge being the result of
    experience (as in Locke) or of reasoning from innate ideas (as in
    Descartes), knowledge and experience are the result of our
    possessing a single set of formal capacities, which Kant describes
    in technical language as the “synthetic a priori.” This reading
    offers a clear explanation of Kant’s so-called “Copernican
    revolution in philosophy.”

     Instructions: Read this webpage. Refer to the Internet Encyclopedia
    of Philosophy reading in Subunit 2.5.1 for help with the
    distinctions Kant draws between synthetic and analytic judgments and
    a priori and a posteriori judgments. This preamble is the first
    section of Kant’s 1783 *Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics - *a
    book he conceived as a more accessible introduction to his major
    work: *The Critique of Pure Reason*. Kant’s general argument is that
    whatever is synthetic and a priori (including judgments about
    mathematics and natural science) lies within the boundaries of
    possible knowledge, while everything else (including judgments about
    whether there are limits to space and time, whether we have free
    will, and whether God exists) does not.

     Instructions: Read the entire webpage. George Berkeley’s
    immaterialism - the belief in the ultimate unimportance of the
    material world - has some interesting parallels with Daoism and
    Eastern philosophy. Berkeley holds that what is real are “ideas,”
    understood specifically that perceptions held in the mind. His
    famous saying is “to be is to be perceived.” God guarantees the
    existence of everything and perceives everything, even when the
    individual person does not. Daoism also focuses on perception and
    the limitations of human understanding.  Read this webpage while
    pondering the similarities among Berkeley and The Zhuangzi andTao Te
