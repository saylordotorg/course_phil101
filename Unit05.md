**Unit 5: Philosophy of Religion** <span id="5"></span> 
*Some of the most fascinating philosophical questions fall under the
rubric of the philosophy of religion. In many different time periods,
cultures, and religious traditions people have asked questions that we
now associate with the sub-field of philosophy known as philosophy of
religion. This area of philosophy tackles such topics as: What happens
to us after we die? Do we possess an immortal soul? Does God exist? If
God exists, how does He affect human life and the rest of the world?
Nearly always, the issue is the question of the respective roles of
faith and reason - whether they are fundamentally complimentary or
opposed. Although many philosophers of religion are themselves believers
in one faith or another, being religious is not a prerequisite for
engaging in philosophical inquiry about religion. Many westerners raised
in the Judeo-Christian context have particular ideas about the soul and
about God. In eastern religions, there may be no concept of an immortal
soul, and the notion of God may be multifaceted or may refer to
consciousness acting as one with all being, all existence. *  
    
 *In this unit, we will be surveying a number of influential approaches
to religious topics. We will begin with a look at Plato’s arguments for
the immortality of the soul. We will then address the question of God’s
existence, considering arguments from Saint Anselm, René Descartes, and
Blaise Pascal. We will also confront Friedrich Nietzsche’s famous and
provocative assertion that “God is dead.” Finally, we will introduce an
Eastern point of comparison by looking at some Buddhist teachings about
the self and the possibility of achieving enlightenment. *

    *[“Phaedo”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/PHIL101-5.1.2.pdf) *(PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the passage. *Phaedo *was written as an account
    of Socrates’s last moments before his execution, as related by his
    friends. Socrates’s impending death lends drama to his arguments for
    the immortality of the soul. Take note of how these arguments depend
    on the metaphysics (the theory of forms) Plato develops in *The
    Republic*.  
        
     Studying this resource should take approximately 8 hours.

     Instructions: Read this webpage, which offers a brief outline of
    the structure of Plato’s arguments. In contrast to the reading from
    Dr. Burrington above, Dr. Speaks provides an analytical outline of
    Plato’s arguments, making it easier to see how his conclusion that
    the soul is immortal depends on a series of premises. Speaks’s
    method also highlights Plato’s development of several parallel
    arguments rather than a single line of thought.  
        
     Studying this reading should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Click on the link above to download the PDF file and
    read Dr. Burr’s introductory comments and then read Saint Anselm’s
    *Proslogion*. Anselm devised the first version of the widely
    influential ontological argument for the existence of God. Take note
    of the translator’s commentary, especially in regard to Saint
    Anselm’s belief that it is possible to provide rational
    demonstrations of articles of faith.  
        
     Studying this reading should take approximately 2 hours.

     Also available in:  
     [HTML](http://www.wright.edu/cola/descartes/meditation3.html)  
      
     Instructions: Read this text. This meditation picks up where we
    left off with Descartes in Unit 1. You may wish to review the first
    two meditations before moving forward. Recall that in the first two
    meditations, Descartes established that he knows one thing for
    certain: that he is thinking, and because he is thinking, he must
    exist. In this meditation, he proceeds from this single idea to his
    proof that God exists. For Descartes, demonstrating God’s existence
    is important not only because it justifies Christian religion but
    also because if he can show that God exists and that God is not by
    nature deceptive, then he can place the basic premises of his
    rational philosophy on a firm foundation.  
        
     Studying this reading should take approximately 2 hours.

**5.2.4 Understanding Descartes’s Causal Argument** <span

-   **Reading: Massachusetts Institute of Technology OpenCourseWare: Dr.
    Rae Langton: “A Study Guide to Descartes’ *Meditations*”**
    Link: Massachusetts Institute of Technology OpenCourseWare: Dr. Rae
    Langton: “[A Study Guide to
    Descartes’ *Meditations*](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/PHIL101-2.3.3.pdf)” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Click the PDF link and then read pages 30 - 35 for a
    brief summary of the argument from Descartes’s third mediation. Dr.
    Langton’s cleverly dubs Descartes’s causal argument for the
    existence of God the “trademark argument” because Descartes’s
    reasoning is, in simplified terms, that God must exist because God
    is the only viable cause that could have produced the idea of God.
    Our innate idea of God, then, is like a trademark that God stamps
    into the rational beings that are his creations. Pay close attention
    to the distinction between “objective” and “formal” reality, as
    Descartes’s usage of these terms is not the conventional one.

     Instructions: Click on the link above and read Section 5. This
    reading offers an alternative analysis of Descartes’s causal
    argument for God’s existence. Section 5b briefly presents
    Descartes’s other, far simpler argument for the existence of God,
    which appears later on in the meditations.

     Instructions: Click on the link above to download the PDF and read
    it. Pascal was a French polymath who lived during the mid-17th
    century. His posthumously published *Pensées* (or *Thoughts*)
    depicts a thinker opposed to the rigid rationalism of Descartes and
    his followers, who insisted that faith and reason were wholly
    incommensurable. The famous “wager” argument he presents for the
    existence of God is intended as an alternative to the deductive
    arguments popular at the time. Some scholars believe that Pascal
    made the suggestion facetiously in order to ridicule the
    rationalists.

    assertions does not give itself up on a single reading but requires
    a great deal of interpretation. His take on the question of God’s
    existence is found in Section 125.  
        
     Studying this reading should take approximately 45 minutes.

    to Buddhism”**
    Link: Stanford University: Waka Takahashi Brown: [“Introduction to
    Buddhism”](http://spice.stanford.edu/docs/116) (HTML) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read this webpage for a concise outline of the
    historical background and intellectual tenets of Buddhist
    philosophy. Buddhism is presented here as a religious doctrine. Like
    most religions, Buddhism is based on a foundation of philosophical
    principles, among which the “four noble truths” are the most
    important because they frame the problem of human life that Buddhist
    thought sets out to solve.

**5.4.2 Buddhist Principles in the Dhammapada** <span

    Dhammapada-Gautama Buddha”**
    Link: University of Evansville: John Richards: [“The
    Dhammapada-Gautama
    Buddha”](http://eawc.evansville.edu/anthology/dhammapada.htm) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this webpage, including the selected verses from
    the *Dhammapada* on the themes of the self, thought, Buddha, and
    enlightenment. The *Dhammapada* forms part of a large body of texts
    passed down orally by Buddha’s disciples, who committed to writing
    these in print sometime after Buddha’s death around the fifth
    century B.C. Two major contrasts are important here. First, unlike
    the Enlightenment era of European philosophers’ questions about God,
    the existence of God or of deities is never in question. The
    important question is “How does one attain enlightenment?” Second,
    notice that the question of the soul is vastly different than in
    Plato. In fact, for Buddha, the illusion of the “self” presents the
    most difficult challenge in achieving freedom from suffering.  
      
     Studying this reading should take approximately 2 hours.

    Philosophy:* Dr. Abraham Velez’s [“Buddha (c.480 BCE - c.400
    BCE)](http://www.iep.utm.edu/buddha/)[”](http://www.iep.utm.edu/buddha/)
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read the introduction as well as Section 2 and
    Section 3. They relate Buddha’s epistemology and metaphysics to the
    task of making progress on the path to enlightenment. The key to
    this reading is the idea that, for Buddha, human beings must tread
    with caution when deciding which “reality” they believe in.
    Unenlightened persons tend to generate “mental constructions,” which
    they take to be real but which prevent them from more genuine
    realizations. The principles Buddha outlines, along with the
    practice of meditation, are aimed at helping people avoid such
    epistemic pitfalls.  
        
     Studying this reading should take approximately 1 hour and 30
    minutes.

     Instructions: Click on the link above and watch the video. It is
    narrated by Nathaniel Paluga (president of the Truth and Beauty
    Institute, which promotes expressions of the intellect and the
    arts). This video provides a unique reading of Schopenhauer’s work
    on pessimism and suffering and compareshis ideas to the teachings of
    Buddha. Schopenhauer, who often focuses on the notion of suffering
    as key to understanding existence, has some interesting parallels
    with the teachings of Buddha.  
      
     Watching the video and taking notes should take approximately 45
    minutes.
