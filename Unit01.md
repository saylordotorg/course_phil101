**Unit 1: What Is Philosophy?** <span id="1"></span> 
*What is philosophy all about, and why should we study it? The second
question is easier to answer than the first. Studying philosophy gives
us insight into the world and our place within it and thus provides us
with a guide for conducting our lives. Understood as the history of
human thought, philosophy relates to the beginning of nearly every other
major academic discipline - from physics to psychology, from religious
studies to biology, and so on. Not only does philosophy force us to
think hard about difficult and fundamental questions, it also teaches us
how to think - providing us with analytical skills we can use in many
other areas. As for the question of what philosophy is about, it is
helpful to begin, as many great philosophers have, with the idea that
the nature of philosophy is itself a matter for philosophical debate.
Phrasing it this way gives us a sense of what to expect throughout this
course, because whatever particular topics philosophers are concerned
with, their practice is always one of questioning. Philosophers from
many different time periods and cultures have asked questions and tried
to answer these questions in ways that can be compared and contrasted.
For example, some philosophers believed that true knowledge came from
contemplation and understanding of the human mind, while others felt
that reliable knowledge came from sensory experiences and testing ideas
against the physical world. The following are some questions
philosophers might consider: How do I know that what I believe is true?
What is the difference between right and wrong? What makes an action
just? What makes a painting beautiful? Does God exist? Are ideas and
concepts more “real,” or is physical matter more “real?” What happens to
us after we die? What kind of government is justified? In this unit, we
will look at the question “What does it mean to study philosophy?”*

    (Flash)  
        
     Instructions: Watch this brief video for an introduction to
    philosophical inquiry. The anecdote that Dr. Corvino uses in this
    video demonstrates that we hold a lot of beliefs out of habit and
    circumstance, not necessarily because we have good reasons to
    believe it. Philosophy is essential in order to question the
    validity of our beliefs and provide better explanations for them.

     Instructions: Watch this video, approximately 3 minutes, for Dr.
    Maudlin’s take on the importance of philosophy in our lives. His
    comments are reminiscent of G. K. Chesterton, who once said that
    “the most practical and important thing” about someone is his or her
    “view of the universe.” We are all mortal, and until each and every
    one of us grapples with the largest of existential questions - “Who
    are we?” “Where did we come from?” and “Where are we going?” - we
    have not lived, we are not prepared to die, and we surely are not
    well educated.

     Instruction: Read Book I from Aristotle’s *Metaphysics*. Note that

    learns to act with certain intellectual virtues and moral virtues,
    and being virtuous leads to a happy, flourishing life.

     Instructions: Click on the link above to access the PDF file. Read
    the text (4 pages) for an argument that philosophical investigation
    is intrinsically valuable. This essay is drawn from a work by the
    famous twentieth century British philosopher Bertrand Russell. While
    the traditional view of philosophy is that it should be valued for
    the truths it reveals, Russell makes a case that its real value lies
    in the *pursuit* of truth and the critical attitude it helps its
    practitioners to develop.

**1.2.4 Review the Glossary of Technical Terms in Philosophy** <span

-   **Reading: Jim Pryor’s “Philosophical Terms and Methods”**
    Link: Jim Pryor’s [“Philosophical Terms and
    Methods”](http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/vocab/glossary.html) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Before you begin your first assessment for this
    course, you may wish to make certain you are familiar with this
    resource. Remember to save it as a bookmark in your web browser for
    consultation throughout this course, especially prior to each
    assessment.  
      
     Here is a special tip about what you should look for in the terms:
    philosophers often use terms in different ways, and especially in
    ways that do not quite match common usage. For example, while in
    common speech “a logical reason” means something like “a reason that
    makes sense” or “a reason that sounds reasonable,” in philosophy “a
    logical reason” typically means “a reason related to a technical
    result in the theory of logic.” Pay special attention to other terms
    that have specialized meanings in philosophy, and be sure to refer
    back to this resource throughout the course.   
      
     Reviewing this resource should take approximately 30 minutes.
