This course will introduce you to the major topics, problems, and
methods of philosophy and surveys the writings of a number of major
historical figures in the field. Philosophy can be - and has been -
defined in many different ways by many different thinkers. In a
scholarly sense, philosophy is the study of the history of human
thought. It requires familiarity with great ideas understood through the
various major thinkers in world history. In its most general sense,
philosophy is simply the investigation of life’s “big questions.” We
will explore such fundamental questions in several of the core areas of
philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, political philosophy,
ethics, and the philosophy of religion. With the help of commentaries
and discussions from a number of contemporary philosophers, we will read
and reflect on texts by major Western and non-Western thinkers including
Lao Tzu, Buddha, Confucius, Plato, Aristotle, Saint Anselm, René
Descartes, Blaise Pascal, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, Thomas Hobbes, John
Stuart Mill, Friedrich Nietzsche, Karl Marx, and Bertrand Russell. This
course aims to not only familiarize  you with philosophers and problems
but to also improve your ability to think critically about the issues,
develop your own ideas about them, and express these ideas clearly and
persuasively in writing. Unit 1 introduces philosophy as a discipline
and provides a sense of its subject matter and methodology. Unit 2
addresses topics in metaphysics and epistemology - traditionally the
“core” areas of philosophy. Units 2, 3, and 4 cover moral, political,
and religious philosophy, respectively. Each unit presents selections
from a set of philosophers whose works are traditionally compared on the
same themes in order to set up contrasting approaches and opinions.

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all its assigned materials. This
includes assessments within each unit as well as at the end of this
course. You will also need to complete:

-   The Final Exam 

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all the course readings, lectures, web media, and
assessments in each unit.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment: **This course should take you approximately **141
hours** to complete. Each unit includes a “Time Advisory” that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should
help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you 11.25 hours to complete.
Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete
Subunit 1.1.1 and Subunit 1.1.2 (a total of 4.75 hours) on Monday night;
Subunit 1.1.3 and Subunit 1.1.4 (a total of 2 hours) on Tuesday night;

night; and so forth.
